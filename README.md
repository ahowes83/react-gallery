# Project Name

React Gallery

## Description

Displays a gallery of images from Tony Hawk's life. The project uses axios and react which are new tools for us. I would like to improve how the images are displayed, but for now I am sticking to the base requirements.

Additional README details can be found [here](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/readme-template/blob/master/README.md).
